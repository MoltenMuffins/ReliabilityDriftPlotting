################ 09 May 2019 ################
Changes:
1. Added Changelog for tracking changes between ReliabilityDriftProgram.exe versions
2. Added Raw Minimum, Raw Maximum, Raw Mean, Raw Standard Deviation Drift Calculations
3. Added Absolute Minimum, Absolute Maximum, Absolute Mean, Absolute Standard Deviation Drift Calculations
4. Amended bug where RTO Database Builder would generate blank rows
5. RTO Database Builder can now read cycle time from foldernames rather than just from filenames
6. Drift Calculations files will now save in a subfolder "Drift Calculation" inside the RTO folder for organization
7. Added file icon for program

Pending Features:
1. Drift Calculation Interactive Plot and Saved Plot functions
2. New GUI for pending feature (1)
3. Automatic SNX replacement
4. Automatic rescaling of numbers to avoid numbers protruding from plots
5. Parallel processing for Database Building

################ 16 May 2019 ################
Changes:
1. New GUI with buttons for new features
2. Interactive Plot for Drift Calculation
3. Saved Plot for Drift Calculation
4. Chinese Text in tooltip for additional guidance
5. Tooltip color changed from yellow to blue

Pending Features:
1. Automatic SNX replacement
2. Automatic rescaling of numbers to avoid numbers protruding from plots
3. Parallel processing for Database Building
4. Add HTOL1, HTOL2
5. Fix bugs with raw data interactive plot
6. Add HTOL1_ref, HTOL2_ref
7. Folder for database
8. Remove quartile numbers from plots

################ 17 May 2019 ################
Changes:
1. Bugs squashed:
	- Build_Database() sometimes forgets to check cycle time of files when putting them together and assigns all data to 0 hours.
	- Database files not sorted by hours
2. Added "Known Bugs" list to Changelog
3. Removed quartile numbers from plots

Pending Features:
1. Automatic SNX replacement
2. Automatic rescaling of numbers to avoid numbers protruding from plots
3. Parallel processing for Database Building
4. Add HTOL1, HTOL2
5. Add HTOL1_ref, HTOL2_ref
6. Folder for database

Known Bugs:
1. AMS logo not included in .exe file

################ 23 May 2019 ################
Changes:
1. Reduced flexibility of Stress hours identification due to incorrect cycle time recognition in cases such as "RTO-4212/HAST/..."
2. Increased flexibility of Stress type identification. (eg. aside from HTOL, HTOL1, HTOL2, HTOLX, HTOL1_ref folders will be recognized as well)
The stress type is identified by keywords ["HTOL", "TH", "TC", "HTSL", "HAST", "Reference"]. THB is not included as the keyword "TH" matches for THB.
~3. Database files now save in their own folder~ (Pending)
4. Added PermissionError handling for when the .csv file to be written to is already open
5. Added AttributeError handling for cycle time regex search

Pending Features:
1. Automatic SNX replacement
2. Automatic rescaling of numbers to avoid numbers protruding from plots
3. Parallel processing for Database Building
5. Add additional stress types for future-proofing
6. Sort RTO database by stress-hours followed by index
7. Option to select folder or individual files for each button function
8. Trendlines for plots (from median to median)
9. Better organization of boxplot folders, perhaps drift boxplots and raw boxplots in separate folders
10. Additional documentation for program/conversion of program into a package
11. Separate boxplotting method for reliability test data (Plot reliabilty data against itself by date instead of cycle time)

Known Bugs:
1. AMS logo not included in .exe file (low priority)
2. Drift Calculation incorrect, possibly due to the sorting of data in the generated RTO database files

################ 24 May 2019 ################
Changes:
1. Trendlines between median points on boxplots (slows down plotting however)
2. Program now excludes files that have "rerun" or "u22" or similar in filenames.
3. Program now sorts RTO database by stress-hours followed by index
4. X and Y labels slightly bigger. Image size decreased from 12x8 to 8x6
5. Automatic resizing of fontspacing of annotations

Pending Features:
1. Automatic SNX replacement
2. Automatic rescaling of numbers to avoid numbers protruding from plots
3. Parallel processing for Database Building
5. Add additional stress types for future-proofing
6. Option to select folder or individual files for each button function
7. Better organization of boxplot folders, perhaps drift boxplots and raw boxplots in separate folders (need to align)
8. Additional documentation for program/conversion of program into a package
9. Separate boxplotting method for reliability test data (Plot reliabilty data against itself by date instead of cycle time)
10. Database files now save in their own folder (need to align on this)

Known Bugs:
1. AMS logo not included in .exe file (low priority)
2. Drift Calculation incorrect, possibly due to the sorting of data in the generated RTO database files (should be resolved now)

################ Futures ################


Pending Features:
1. Automatic SNX replacement (take last value of retest dataframe)
2. Automatic rescaling of numbers to avoid numbers protruding from plots
3. Parallel processing for Database Building
5. Add additional stress types for future-proofing
6. Option to select folder or individual files for each button function
7. Better organization of boxplot folders, perhaps drift boxplots and raw boxplots in separate folders (need to align)
