# ReliabilityDriftPlotting

## Introduction
`ReliabilityDriftPlotting` is a Python module that I built as part of my credit bearing internship as a `Failure Analysis & Reliability` intern at AMS Semiconductors Singapore from January to June 2019.

Relibility testing of semiconductor devices is a process that requires the generation and analysis of data pertaining to the performance degradation of semiconductor devices over time.

While the amount of data generated is not considered "big data", it still took the team several days to compile, analyse and plot the data in Microsoft Excel.
As I was interested in further developing my Python programming skills, my supervisor was willing to let me automate the processing of data for the department.

The `ReliabilityDriftPlotting` module was built according to three specifications:
1. Aggregate data from proprietary data files
2. Plot data and compare device performance to target device performance
3. Able to be built as an executable so it can be run without a Python enviroment
